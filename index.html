        <p>Mainly all the hype in the field of <em>Machine Learning</em> and <em>Neural Networks</em> has led the students of this decade to learn and research in this field, and the primary issue faced by lot of students and researchers is the availability of proper infrastructure.</p>

        <p><em>Google Colaboratory</em> or simply <em>colabs</em> is a web-tool from Google that gives access to free GPUs and CPUs to aid in research and development of <em>high performance computing</em> programs.</p>

        <p>This research paper talks about a method to mitigate the limitations concerning such free servers and utilize them to the fullest.</p>

          During the years 1962 – 1963 Camargue, South France saw an outbreak of mosquito-borne disease. Later in 1996, an epidemic occurred over the entire Europe during which countries like Romania identified about 400 cases. This disease which was causing fever and other related symptoms was named West Nile Virus (WNV). The virus is now found throughout the world across the continental United States, Europe, Africa, The Middle East, and west Asia. 
        </p>
          <p>In this paper, we will be discussing the spread of WNV and its future trajectory based on the temperature and climate of regions. We will show how intervention strategies will change the graph of the model.
