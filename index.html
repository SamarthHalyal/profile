        <p>Mainly all the hype in the field of <em>Machine Learning</em> and <em>Neural Networks</em> has led the students of this decade to learn and research in this field, and the primary issue faced by lot of students and researchers is the availability of proper infrastructure.</p>

        <p><em>Google Colaboratory</em> or simply <em>colabs</em> is a web-tool from Google that gives access to free GPUs and CPUs to aid in research and development of <em>high performance computing</em> programs.</p>

        <p>This research paper talks about a method to mitigate the limitations concerning such free servers and utilize them to the fullest.</p>

          During the years 1962 – 1963 Camargue, South France saw an outbreak of mosquito-borne disease. Later in 1996, an epidemic occurred over the entire Europe during which countries like Romania identified about 400 cases. This disease which was causing fever and other related symptoms was named West Nile Virus (WNV). The virus is now found throughout the world across the continental United States, Europe, Africa, The Middle East, and west Asia. 
        </p>
          <p>In this paper, we will be discussing the spread of WNV and its future trajectory based on the temperature and climate of regions. We will show how intervention strategies will change the graph of the model.

          Although Space Exploration seems like to be technologically initiated in 19th Century, the actual ground work was layed from the times of Aristotle and Socrates. As it was once an fiction story for many, the 19th Century made space travel a reality and with it began many Ethical ideas.  
        </p>
        <p>
          In this paper I discuss the ethical issues of space exploration that affects humans as well as the universe as we know it. Because we cannot use the same ethical thinking in space that we use here on earth. I also propose some methods on how to tackle these issue by modifying the rules and laws that we have here on earth.

          In the ongoing battle against global pandemics, understanding the key determinants that fuel outbreaks are of paramount importance. With this focus, our study aims to assess and rank the predictive capabilities of a wide range of socio-economic, eco-climatic, and spatiotemporal variables in predicting Lassa Fever (LF) outbreaks, using data from previous Nigerian outbreaks (2012-2019). Employing machine learning methods, particularly XGBoost and Random Forest, our study aims to offer accurate and robust predictions concerning LF incidence rates. As a crucial add-on, we leverage the innovative SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) technique as a postprocessing tool to dissect and better understand the contributions of individual features towards the predictions generated by our machine learning models.

              Lassa Fever (LF) is a viral hemorrhagic fever prevalent in numerous regions of West Africa, with Nigeria being a particularly prominent area of endemicity. Lassa mammarenavirus (LASV) is the etiological agent responsible for LF and poses a significant threat to both human and animal populations 
            </p>
              <p>In this research, we studied the behaviour of different algorithms names Random Forest Regressors and XGBoost in early detection of lassa fever. We also did a SHAP analysis on the Nigerian CDC Dataset to extract various features responsible for better prediction of the disease.
